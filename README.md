This function automates attendance notifications for students:
* Opens a Google Sheet with attendance data.
* Checks if any student has 3+ absences or lates and hasnâ€™t already been notified.
* Sends an email reminder with program attendance expectations.
* Logs each notification and updates the sheet to avoid duplicates.
* It ensures students stay informed and helps staff enforce attendance policies efficiently.
